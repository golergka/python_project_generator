# Template Python Project

This template project provides a simple structure to quickly set up a Python project with dependency management, Python version management, Git setup, and global command registration.

## Project Structure

```
template_project/
│
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── setup.py
└── src/
    └── template_project/
        ├── init.py
        └── main.py
```

- `.gitignore`: A standard Python `.gitignore` file to avoid committing unwanted files.
- `pyproject.toml`: This file is used to manage dependencies and specify the required Python version. We use Poetry for dependency management.
- `README.md`: A description of your project, installation instructions, usage, and any other relevant information.
- `setup.py`: This file is used to make your project installable via `pip` and to register the script as a global command.
- `src/template_project/`: This is where your actual project code should be placed.
- `src/template_project/__init__.py`: Empty file that is used to mark a directory as a Python package. It allows the Python interpreter to treat the directory as a package, which means you can import modules and functions from this directory in other Python scripts.

## Development

To work with the project, you will need to have Poetry installed (https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

To install the project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

To run the project:

```bash
poetry run your-entry-point
```

To build and package the project:

```bash
poetry build
```

To install the project locally as a global command:

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

Now, you can run the command from anywhere in your system:

```bash
your-entry-point
```

Don't forget to replace `your-entry-point` with the desired command name specified in `setup.py`.
